                The grocery store(Akuaâ€™s Mart) is the largest in the community and always has all products that a customer wants.
                For this reason everyone wants to go there, and the place tends to get crowded which is unsafe especially during this pandemic period

                Corona Virus Disease is a newly identified Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) caused by a novel corona virus named SARS-CoV-2.
                The spread of the disease in humans is mainly through droplets arising from people sneezing, coughing or speaking which is then transferred to mucosal surfaces (eyes, nose and mouth) via the hands.
                <br>There is currently no cure for the virus and this puts everyone, especially our workers who are considered as frontline workers. To ensure that social distancing rules are being followed and the risk of transmission to our workers is reduced, we have launched our store online.
                <br>Safety Protocols are also being adhered in our warehouses to ensure that the risk of contamination is low and products delievered to you are safe.
                <br>
