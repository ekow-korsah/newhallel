OVERVIEW
Team S is developing a data powered website to help a grocery store owner solve the issue of a crowded store, especially during this pandemic season.
The website helps reduce the spread of COVID-19 by reducing the number of physical contact at the mart. We help increase sales by
making shopping more convenient and safe for customers as we battle the virus collectively.
